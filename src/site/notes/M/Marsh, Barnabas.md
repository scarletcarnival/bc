# Marsh, Barnabas

The son of [[M/Marsh, Onesiphorus\|Marsh, Onesiphorus]], and grandson of [[M/Marsh, Obed\|Obed Marsh]]; he marries an unsuspecting (and very unfortunate) young woman from nearby [[Ipswich\|Ipswich]], [[M/Massachusetts\|Massachusetts]], circa 1877. He is still alive in 1927, and the owner of the [[Marsh Refining Company\|Marsh Refining Company]]. He has not been seen in public since about 1917, and although he continues to visit the gold refinery occasionally, it is always in a limousine with curtained windows. Barnabas Marsh was a great dandy in his youth, and is said to continue to wear the “frock-coated finery” popular in his younger years, but *adapted* to certain physical changes. [[A/Allen, Zadok\|Zadok Allen]] says that Barnabas Marsh is “about changed” and can no longer shut his eyes; soon he will depart to live under the sea as one of the [[D/Deep Ones\|Deep Ones]]. The narrator sees him late the same night, leading a search party down the Rowley road: a dreadful figure “clad in a ghoulishly humped black coat and striped trousers, {with} a man’s felt hat perched on the shapeless thing that answered for a head.”
