# Miskatonic River

A fictitious river in [[M/Massachusetts\|Massachusetts]], first mentioned in *The Picture in the House*. It seems as if it must flow from west to east across the state. The town of [[D/Dunwich\|Dunwich]], in north central Massachusetts, is on the Miskatonic’ s upper reaches. The river flows through the town of [[A/Arkham\|Arkham]] towards the coast, and enters the sea at [[K/Kingsport\|Kingsport]]. The mill town of [[Bolton\|Bolton]] is apparently up the river from Arkham, but not far away. In the middle of the river at [[A/Arkham\|Arkham]] is an uninhabited island, with “moss-grown rows of grey standing stones” of “obscure and immemorial” origin. [[G/Gilman, Walter\|Walter Gilman]] rows out to this island twice to sketch the angles formed by the rows of stones. On April 19 as he walks across the Garrison Street bridge and looks upstream, he sees Keziah Mason standing on the island, and runs away.
