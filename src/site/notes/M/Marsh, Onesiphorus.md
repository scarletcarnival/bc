# Marsh, Onesiphorus

The eldest son of [[M/Marsh, Obed\|Obed Marsh]] and his first, human wife. Along with the first wife’s other children, he was dead by the time of the tale’s events in 1927. Onesiphorus Marsh marries “another o’ them as wa’n’t never seed {was never seen} aoutdoors,” [[A/Allen, Zadok\|Zadok Allen]] said, referring presumably, to one of the Deep Ones. As a result, his son Barnabas would mutate into a [[Deep One\|Deep One]] and be relatively immortal.
