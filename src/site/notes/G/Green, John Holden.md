John Holden Greene (1777-1850) was a noted early nineteenth century architect practicing in Providence, Rhode Island. The bulk of his work dates to the late Federal period, and is mostly in the architectural style of the same name. Greene is responsible for the design of over fifty buildings built in the city between 1806 and 1830, almost half of which are still standing.

During this period, Greene was influential in introducing the L-shaped plan to domestic design. He also introduced the Gothic style to Providence with his house for Sullivan Dorr, completed in 1809. The distinctive early nineteenth century Federal architecture of the city is largely attributed to Greene and his apprentices. After 1830, his identified works were all designed in the Greek Revival style, though he did not become known for this style.

Though Greene's influence waned after the emergence of Greek Revival architects James C. Bucklin, Russell Warren and others, his style was revived in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries as part of the larger Colonial Revival movement.
