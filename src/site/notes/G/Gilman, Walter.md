# Gilman, Walter

See *The Dreams in the Witch House*

[[M/Miskatonic University\|Miskatonic University]] undergraduate from Haverhill, Massachusetts (a non-fictitious town). He deliberately rents Keziah Mason’s old attic garret in the Witch House. At Miskatonic, he studies higher mathematics, physics, folklore, and their possible interconnection. He suffers from a chronic fever while experiencing dreams of growing vividness and complexity and enjoying heightened abilities in mathematics and physics. The dreams involve Keziah Mason, Brown Jenkin, a “Black Man,” and journeys into spaces lying outside our own dimension. As Walpurgis Night (April 30) draws near, his dreams seem more and more real, and during the daytime he feels himself “drawn” toward certain parts of the sky. He seeks help on a number of occasions from his fellow-student and fellow-lodger Frank Elwood. On Walpurgis Night, in some fourth-dimensional place, Gilman tries unsuccessfully to halt the sacrifice of the kidnapped infant Ladislas Wolejko, killing Keziah Mason in the process. On the next morning he is found on the floor of his room, with his eardrums ruptured as if by some tremendous sound (a sound nobody else heard, however). That afternoon, as Gilman lies resting under blankets, Brown Jenkin makes a surprise attack from below. Gilman dies badly, “emitting sounds of veritably inhuman nature, as if racked by some torment beyond description,” while “writhing under the bedclothes.” When the covers are pulled back, the doctor and witnesses see that there was “a virtual tunnel through his body—something had eaten his heart out.”
