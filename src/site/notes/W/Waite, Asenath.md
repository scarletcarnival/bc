# Waite, Asenath

Also [[W/Waite, Asenath\|Asenath Derby]]
Wife of [[D/Derby, Edward Pickman\|Edward Pickman Derby]]
Daughter (and reincarnation of) [[W/Waite, Ephraim\|Ephraim Waite]]


The daughter of [[W/Waite, Ephraim\|Ephraim Waite]], who is one of the “[[I/Innsmouth\|Innsmouth]] Waites.” After her father Ephraim’s death as a raving lunatic locked in an attic, she is sent to be a boarding student at the Hall School in [[K/Kingsport\|Kingsport]], and later attends [[M/Miskatonic University\|Miskatonic University]], where she studies metaphysics and medieval lore. She meets and marries the bookish, unworldly [[D/Derby, Edward Pickman\|Edward Derby]], a match that surprises his friends. It becomes increasingly apparent during the tale that the immeasurably evil Ephraim Waite, by some occult means, transferred his persona from his old, dying body to the young, healthy body of his child Asenath, leaving her to die in the horror of his withered old man’s frame (certainly explaining the raving madness in which “Ephraim” expired). 

Like so many of HPL’s collection of personal names for his New England characters, Asenath was one of the Old Testament names that were so popular among the early English colonists. The biblical Asenath was a woman in the Book of Genesis, whose name is thought to stem from the Egyptian language, for “belonging to {the goddess} Neit” she was the daughter of an Egyptian priest, who married the Hebrew patriarch Joseph and became the mother of his youngest sons, Ephraim (!) and Manasseh.
