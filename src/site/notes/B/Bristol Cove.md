## History

### Arcane Beginnings

Bristol Cove ("The Cove") was founded in 1658 by three men who headed what would become known as the Triptych Families. [[B/Blackwood, Edmund\|Sir Edmund Blackwood]], [[B/Brandon, Hillary\|Admiral Hillary Brandon]], and [[H/Hearthbrige, Robert\|Lord Robert Hearthbridge]]. It was under the cover of darkness that all three men and their crews would converge upon the bluffs (later named [[Hearthbridge Bluffs\|Hearthbridge Bluffs]]) and assemble in the caves that lined the bluffs to meet in secret for clandestine purposes. Bristol Cove was positioned as a simple seaport at the mouth of the [[W/Wexford River\|Wexford River]] and lucky enough to be within trading distance to several local tribes of natives. It is said the town prospered in spite of the sparse trading as no one actually observed commerce between the town and all indigenous people mysteriously disappeared within the first two decades leaving the expanse around the town open for farming expansion without conflict of raiding parties. 

All of the families melted into the landscape but continued to cast a shadow over the area that remained uncontested until the Depression of the 1940s. Whispers of the [[C/Cthulhu Cult\|Cthulhu Cult]] were heavy throughout the entire history of the Cove, but never proved. Unlike its unlucky sister, Innsmouth, the Cove was left alone by authorities as the money and power of the Triptych Families swayed curiosity seekers away from the town and bolstered the reputation of the town as a haven of the East Coast Elite.
